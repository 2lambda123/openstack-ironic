upgrade:
  - |
    Operators may need to check their ``/httpboot/redfish`` folder permissions
    if using ``redfish-virtual-media``. The conductor was previously creating
    the folder with incorrect permissions.
  - |
    A permission setting has been added for ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot
    interface, which allows for explicit file permission setting when the
    driver is being used. The default for the new ``[redfish]file_permission
    setting is ``0u644``, or 644 if manually changed using ``chmod`` on the
    command line. Operators MAY need to adjust this if they were running the
    conductor with a specific ``umask`` to work around the permission setting
    defect.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the ``redfish-virtual-media`` and related based drivers to utilize
    an explicit file permission instead of rely upon the ironic-conductor
    umask, which may be incorrect. This can be tuned with the
    ``[redfish]file_permission`` setting.
  - |
    Fixes an issue where the default folder permission for the
    ``redfish-virtual-media`` driver where the folder permissions for the
    ``/httpboot/redfish`` folder was being created with incorrect
    permissions.
