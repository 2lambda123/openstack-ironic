    Adds basic support for managing RAID configuration via the Redfish
    out-of-band (OOB) management protocol to the ``idrac`` hardware type by
    adding new interface named ``idrac-redfish``.

    iDRAC firmware greater than 4.40.00.00 is required. Compared to
    ``idrac-wsman`` implementation does not yet support foreign disks and
    converting from non-RAID mode.

    Backing physical disk hints are not widely tested with ``idrac-redfish``
    yet and they might not work as desired. Backing physical disks
    (``controller``, ``physical_disks``) with ``size_gb="MAX"`` are tested.

    The ``idrac`` hardware type now supports ``idrac-wsman``, ``idrac``,
    ``idrac-redfish``, and ``no-raid`` interfaces in given priority
    order.
