    The configuration option ``[deploy]ramdisk_image_download_source`` now
    supports a new value ``swift``. If ``boot_iso`` or ``deploy_iso`` is a
    Glance image, it will expose it via a Swift temporary URL. For other types
    of images the new value works the same way as the existing ``http``.
