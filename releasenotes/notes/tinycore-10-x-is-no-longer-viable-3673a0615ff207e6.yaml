    TinyCore Linux 10.x, which powers the TinyIPA ramdisk in the Ussuri and
    Train releases of OpenStack, is no longer able to be built due to
    certificate verification issues as time moves forward. We have embedded
    a fix for use by Ironic's CI only. As a general reminder, TinyIPA
    should not be used in production deployments.
